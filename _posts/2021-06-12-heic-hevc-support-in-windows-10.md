(While it is ridiculous that you need to do this,) to add HEIC/HEVC support to Windows 10 Photos app, either:

Open a browser and paste:

```
ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9n4wgh0z6vhq
```

Open a cmd window and paste:

```
start ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9n4wgh0z6vhq
```

Then click install.
